				<img alt="A map showing the railway line between Paston Whitchurch station and Paston Oatvile station just south of it. The viaduct lies between them where the railway line crosses the river and the golf links; a field path runs parallel to the railway. The Hatcheries is just west of Paston Whitchurch station, while the Dormy House is situated just west of Paston Oatvile station. A railway timetable shows that the 3 oâ€™clock train from London arrives in Binver at 3:59 without stopping at either station, while the 3:47 London train ends at the Paston Oatvile station at 4:43, while another train departs Paston Oatvile at 4:50 for Binver, arriving at 5:09." src="../images/map.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
